# Rating Country* Flags

A flag is a piece of fabric that is used a symbol, a signalling device, or as decoration.

However, some countries do not understand this.

## Criteria for Rating

My criteria for rating has a few main ideals.

I believe that a country's flag must be recognized from a distance, even when curled slightly on a flag pole.
A good flag is also recognizable when displayed wrong, such as upside down.
Additionally, a good flag is meaningful, but doesn't grasp at straws.
A good flag should only copy another for historical reasons.
This means that former colonies can copy to an extent.
In the case of common patterns such as stripes or cross, I generally rank the original higher.

Basically,

- **Simplicity** over complexity.
- **Recognizable**.
- Words are bad.
- **Minimalistic symbols** over complex seals.
- **Two to four colors**.
- Only copy if rooted in **history**.
- Once again seals and words are bad.

I have a few things I do not care about:

- Flag ratios, unless that is the only distinct feature.
- Flag shape.
- Cost to manufacture.

Curved lines and complex sewing can cause flags to be more expensive to produce and wear more easily, however I am ranking flags based on digital images only.

## Criteria for a "country"

Now that my criteria for rating is laid out, I must specify the list of flags to be rated.
Choosing flags to rate has many asterisks.
While the title says "country" flags I am rating the flags of the areas defined by [ISO3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1).
Well, mainly, I have included a few more.

This list includes territories and other areas that aren't independent, however they usually have a distinct flag.
Currently, this list is *249* areas (however, not 249 unique flags).

Countries with the same flag as another:

- Bouvet Island - Norway
- Heard Island and McDonald Island - Australia
- Saint Martin - France
- Svalbard and Jan Mayen - Norway
- United States Minor Outlying Islands - United States

Other cases; I will rate countries of the United Kingdom separately.

I have chosen to include Kosovo.

I am using the most recent flag, regardless of history or politics.
For example, the first flag on the list, Afghanistan, will not be rated based on the tricolor.

Some island nations that were former colonies have official flags of the their former owners, however to give them a fair fight, I will be using common unofficial flags.
For example, Caribbean Netherlands' official flag is the same as Netherlands.

## Rating

The ratings will be out of *100*.
The order is alphabetical.

### Afghanistan

![Afghanistan Flag](af.png)

Rating: 20 / 100

Having 19 different flags since 1901 usually means conflict.
This "most recent", and disputed flag, represents a stark contrast to the "previous" tri-color.

My criteria does ask for meaning, however without grasping at straws.
I would argue that white representing "purity of faith and government" is boring and played out.
The Shahada in the center does add meaning, but these points are ruined by the lack of readability when curled on a pole.
A more simplistic script (Arabic has so many scripts to choose) would better.

### Åland

![Åland Flag](ax.png)

Rating: 55 / 100

While having the Nordic cross is boring, this flag  one of the exception, due to history.
The inclusion of the defacing red line over the Swedish flag is an interesting choice, due to Åland's
historic opinion of Sweden being generally greater than Finland.
Overall, not an outstanding flag, but recognizable and includes a design rooted in history.

### Albania

![Albania Flag](al.png)

Rating: 85 / 100

Easy to recognize flag.
Good two color choice, easy to represent on computers with a limited color palette.
The two headed eagle icon has a good level of detail, and has a long history.
Overall, a solid flag, something to proud of.

### Algeria

![Algeria Flag](dz.png)

Rating: 46 / 100

Overused star and crescent.
Points for good star placement.
Good shade of green.
Overall, a good bicolor flag held back by its overused symbol.

### American Samooa

![American Samoa Flag](as.png)

Rating: 65 / 100

Very American.
Not very Samoan.
A lots of points using a high schooler's design.
The fue and uatogi should be have higher contrast against the white triangle, drawing the eye away from the eagle.

### Andorra

![Andorra Flag](ad.png)

Rating: 60 / 100

Initially this had a lower score, but I learned this the first adopted (1866) tricolor of these colors.
This flag has a list of requirements for it include, and I recognize that as a hard task.
This flag has to include a bit of France, Foix, and Catalonia in the design.
Maybe a seal the best option in this case.
The tricolor is a good choice, and everyone else copied it, so I feel sorry for it.
Overall, this flag is a pretty good attempt to include a long list of regions and cultures, on the backdrop of the tricolor of the most boring Napoleon.

### Angola

![Angola Flag](ao.png)

Rating: 85 / 100

A good representation of having a powerful recognizable symbol.
This flag attempts its own take on the hammer and sickle, which is more rare on flags today (meaning no loss of points).
The government made a new, happier flag in 2003, but no one uses it, and to be honest I see why; this shit is hard.

### Anguilla

![Anguilla Flag](ai.png)

Rating: 18 / 100

Angry rating.
A good flag ruined by the union jack.
Look at the Republic of Anguilla flag (1967-1969), now that is a great flag.
This current official flag is a reason in itself to revolt.

### Antarctica

![Antarctica Flag](aq.png)

Rating: 78 / 100

Good colors (despite copying the UN flag).
Recognizable for anyone who has looked at a map.
I hope other countries do not get any ideas, the country outline is a bad idea.

### Antigua and Barbuda

![Antigua and Barbuda Flag](ag.png)

Rating: 67 / 100

I would argue that five colors is too many for most flags.
Additionally, the inverted triangle being a "V" for victory is a stretch.
However, this a recognizable flag so I can't fault it too much.
Although, the flag of the Barbuda Council is better, so maybe a redesign is in order.

### Argentina

![Argentina Flag](ar.png)

Rating: 78 / 100

A strong triband entry.
The original "South/Central American" triband, that influenced many other countries.
A good symbol in the center, meaning and detailed, yet easy to identify when curled or blurred.
Overall, one of the best South American flag, I hope all their neighbors don't copy it.

### Armenia

![Armenia Flag](am.png)

Rating: 60 / 100

Low tricolor rating because of the copying of Colombia.
Arguable a forgettable tricolor.
Armenia should go back to the medieval flags.

### Aruba

![Aruba Flag](aw.png)

Rating: 65 / 100

Classic Whitney Smith design; devoid of human touch.
Good color theory, but boring strip design.
Points for not just being a flag of the Netherlands plus a small symbol.

### Australia

![Australia Flag](au.png)

Rating: 48 / 100

Two major issues, the union jack and bad symbol.
Australia has a bunch of recognizable objects that are unique to its unique ecosystem and culture, but they chose stars.
I know the sky is different in each hemisphere, but should flags show a constellation that the whole southern part of the world can see?
Remove the union jack and add a kangaroo, or the aboriginal flag and we will talk.


### Austria

![Austria Flag](at.png)

Rating: 62 / 100

All of these points are due to being the second oldest adopted currently used flag (after the similar Denmark flag) and the legend.
The legend of Duke Leopold V is the best flag legend I have heard, especially to describe such a simple flag design.

### Azerbaijan

![Azerbaijan Flag](az.png)

Rating: 70 / 100

A solid tricolor entry.
A common symbol rooted in heritage and history means no point loss.
Lots of points due to not copying the color selection.

### Bahamas

![Bahamas Flag](bs.png)

Rating: 73 / 100

A great use of a rare flag color.
Points for using aquamarine and removing the Union Jack.
Only wish that I saw it more places than on just on tax evading cruise ships.

### Bahrain

![Bahrain Flag](bh.png)

Rating: 61 / 100

Points deduced due to the similarity with Qatar.
Interestingly, even the historical flags are similar to Qatar's.
Of course the 5 points stand for the Five Pillars of Islam, but outside of that it is easier to view than the 28 points.

### Bangladesh

![Bangladesh Flag](bd.png)

Rating: 73 / 100

I understand the decision to simplify the flag from the original (with the map of Bangladesh).
Classical red symbolism, representing blood, but I didn't know that green was supposed to represent the lushness of the land.
Overall, the "Japanese Circle" motif is not overused, so it works for Bangladesh.

### Barbados

![Barbados Flag](bb.png)

Rating: 85 / 100

A wonderful flag.
Extremely recognizable, even for those who don't use cruise ships trying to avoid taxes.

### Belarus

![Belrus Flag](by.png)

Rating: 51 / 100

The ratio is unique, but frankly pointless.
The "complex" (for a flag) pattern on the edge is interesting, since that part will stay flat on a pole.

### Belgium
