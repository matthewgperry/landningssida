## Tech I Use

This page contains the gadgets I use on a daily basis.
This list is mainly computers, but also I would like to share some other tools I recommend.

All of my workstations run Artix linux, and my server runs Proxmox with a lot of Debian virtual machines running Docker.

### Computers

**Main PC**, AMD Ryzen 7 7700x, 32 GB DDR5-6000, RX 7800 XT 16 GB

**Thinkpad T460p**, Intel i7-6820HQ, 16 GB RAM, GeForce 940MX

**Macbook Pro (Early 2015/A1502, 13")**, Intel I5-5257U, 8 GB RAM, MacOS completely removed (runs Artix like everything else) 

**Dell Poweredge T320**, Intel Xeon E5-2470 v2, 72 GB ram, currently has 12TB and 4TB ZFS pools, both RAID-Z1 (~32TB raw)

### Peripherals

**Custom Tofu60 2.0**, modded plate and PCB to fit Alps, Alps Salmon switches, HHKB layout. Currently my daily driver, due to the price I paid for all the parts.

[Quagga keyboard](/projects/splitkeyboard)

**Tester68 keyboard**, Gateron Yellow Pro switches.

**YMDK YMD40 (AIR40)**, Cherry "New Nixies" switches.

[Waterfowl Keyboard](https://keeb.io/products/waterfowl-36-key-split-keyboard-kit), Boba U4T Silent switches, currently broken :(

**Logitech G502 mouse**, I hate shopping for mice.

### Misc

**Google Pixel 4a**, runs Graphene OS, most apps from FDroid

**Kobo Clara HD ereader**, bought used, highly recommend, especially with KoReader and sideloading

**Flipper Zero**

**Sony PS Vita (2000)**, soft modded, 512GB SD card

**Pinecil V2**, soldering iron, runs IronOS
