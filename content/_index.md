# Welcome

I am currently a ~~fourth-year~~ graduated Computer Engineering student.
My interests lay in embedded systems, computer architecture, unix, and exploring the low-level weeds.
I especially enjoy forcing consumer smart home products to work with a privacy-first mindset.
This website is an experiment in a relatively low bloat website, without Javascript or CSS classes.
